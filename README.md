# salesforce-email

This package provides a validation function that check that the given email address is compatible
with Salesforce.
It follows [the salesforce format][1] for the local-part and [Mozilla regex][2] for the domain-part of the email.

Like Salesforce, it does not respect the [RFC 6532](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6532) and will reject emails with accents and other special characters.

Unlike Salesforce, it does not accept comments; for example john.doe@(comment)example.com, and john.doe@example.com(comment) are allowed by salesforce but rejected by this module.

## Installation

With npm:

    npm i salesforce-email

Or with yarn

    yarn install salesforce-email

## Usage

```js
import { isValidEmail } from 'salesforce-email'

console.log(isValidEmail('foo@bar.com')) // true
```
